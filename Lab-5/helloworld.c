/*
    Description
   For the lab assignment, you are to write a function to calculate the logarithm of a number for an
    arbitrary base. This function should be named logAny() and it should take parameters of the number
    whose log you wish to calculate, and the base to be used.


    In order to test your logAny() function, you must go through the integers from 1 through 8192 doubling
    your counter each time (i.e., 1,2,4,8,16,32,â€¦,8192). For each of the selected integers, you should display
    that number on a line and then the following logs of that number on indented lines below it: the log
    base 2, log base 4, log base 8, log base 16, and log base 32. See the sample output for an example
*/

int value;
int counter = 0;
double logValue;
int main(void){

    printf("Gello");
}
